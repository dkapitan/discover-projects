# UCI SECOM dataset

Approaches for the class imbalance problem, feature selection and causality in semicondutor manufacturing process line data.


## Data Description
The SECOM dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository is semicondutor manufacturing data which has 1567 records, 590 anonymized features and 104 fails. The process yield has a simple pass/fail response (encoded -1/1).

The dataset has the following characteristics:

1.	two-class problem
2.	an imbalance with a 14:1 skew of pass to fails
2.	large number of features -- 590
3.	missing data
4.	features/columns which do not have sufficient information
5.	4% of the columns/features have more than 50% of their records missing
6.	some columns have constant values 


## Exercises
The SECOM dataset presents us with two problems, namely

1. Working with skewed data, i.e. an imbalanced classification problem (see <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>)
2. Feature selection (see <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>)

In this project, you will explore both tasks.

### Exercise 1: Imbalanced classification

  - Try to successfully predict fails using i) cost sensitive learning approach and ii) sampling-based approach
  - Evaluate performance using the precision-recall curve
  - Discuss the pros and cons of different operating points on the PR curve 

### Exercise 2: Feature reduction
A secondary objective will be feature reduction. A streamlined feature set can not only lead to better prediction accuracy and data understanding but also save manufacturing resources. Explore causal understanding of the manufacturing process using the 590 features.
